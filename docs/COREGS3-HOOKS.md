# CoreGS 3.0 phase 1: the observe-only EE hooks and the `.gt4scene` capture

Date: 2026-11-05. State after the first implementation round of TASK-090 phase 1 (`docs/COREGS3-PLAN.md` §4, §5.2, §8).
Scope of this document: what the hooks are, where they sit, what they may read, what the capture contains, and what the
first real captures proved and did not prove. Labels follow the plan: **C** Confirmed, **H** High confidence, **Hyp**
Hypothesis, **U** Unknown.

## 1. What was built

| Piece | File | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| Hook entry points, switch, capture writer, counters | `native/coregs3/coregs3_hooks.{hpp,cpp}` | host code linked into `gt4vulkan` behind `GT4_COREGS3` |
| Scene snapshot and `.gt4scene` format | `native/coregs3/coregs3_scene.{hpp,cpp}` | pure data, shared with the offline tools |
| Bounded VIF decoder | `native/coregs3/coregs3_vif.{hpp,cpp}` | pure C++, no game data |
| Shape channels, default role rule, mesh | `native/coregs3/coregs3_shape.{hpp,cpp}` | pure C++ |
| CPU reference rasteriser | `native/coregs3/coregs3_render.{hpp,cpp}` | pure C++ |
| PNG writer (stored DEFLATE) | `native/coregs3/coregs3_png.{hpp,cpp}` | pure C++, test tool only |
| Offline tool | `native/tools/coregs3_render_main.cpp` (`gt4_coregs3_render`) | test tool only |
| Unit insertion | `scripts/coregs3_units.py` | copies translated units, inserts the calls, proves byte-exact removal |
| Identity gate | `scripts/coregs3_bench/coregs3-check.sh` | three headless replays, clock/digest/state/frame identity |

`GT4_COREGS3=off|shadow|overlay` selects the mode. `off` (the default) makes every entry point one branch.
`shadow` captures and renders nothing visible. `overlay` **refuses to start**: the live seam is not in this build, and
refusing is better than silently running in another mode.

## 2. Hook sites and what each one reads

| Id | Guest site | Insertion | Reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| K1 pre | `0x00455A5C` (`jal 0x0049D308` of `ModelSet2___render`) | before the call statement, in `unit_00D5.cpp` | a0 = the shape's `Cmd`; PGL context at scratchpad `0x70002000` (sparse spans); VU0 `vf24..vf31` |
| K1 post | `0x00455A64` (the continuation) | after the label | the eight qwords `func_0049E548` wrote at the PGL output cursor (the matrix packet VU1 receives at `0xC1`) |
| K3 | `L_0033EBB4` (after the projection virtual call) | at the label | PGL `+0xFA0` block, camera object address, VU0 `vf24..vf31` |
| K4 | `L_0033EBF4` (after the modelview virtual call) | at the label | the same at the modelview point |
| K5 begin | `L_0033EE28` (block start before `vt+0x380`) | at the label | pass counter |
| K5 end | `L_0033EE54` (return of `vt+0x380` = `0x00340950`) | at the label | pass counter |

The bracket is confirmed against the decompiled `func_0033EAB8`: the block between the two labels contains exactly the
`vt+0x380` call, and the vtable entry resolved at run time is `0x00340950` (`RacePS2Base` `render_cars`), read from
`*(self+0x64) + 0x380 + 4` at the hook (**C**, measured: the trace prints `cars(+380) 00340950`).

**K2 (`func_0049CEA0`) is intentionally not hooked.** The item's `event` halfword already carries the 9-bit texture index
and the 7-bit material index, and the record arrays plus their external cursors are guest globals
(`0x0084AF58/5C/60/64`, `0x00624C7C/80`). The capture resolves exactly the addresses `func_0049CEA0` would resolve, from the
same words, without a second hook. This is a deliberate deviation from the plan's hook table and is recorded here.

## 3. The identity guarantee

- The hooks read guest RAM and scratchpad through bounds-checked copies and read `Cpu` fields; they never write guest
  memory, never call guest code and never touch `c.budget`, so no guest cycle is added or removed.
- Every bound is checked before a read; a read failure is counted (`guest_read_failures`) and never guessed around.
- A frame that hits a capacity limit is refused as a whole (`refused_frames`) and counted per cause
  (`CaptureCounters::overflow`), never truncated.
- `GT4_COREGS3=off` leaves the capture file closed and every entry point one branch; the identity gate compares that run
  against a build without the hooks.

Frame boundaries: `at_vblank` (the donor's per-VBlank callback) closes the frame the guest just finished and opens the
next one. The capture therefore holds exactly one VBlank interval per frame whatever the guest's render ordering is. A
run that never installs a VBlank callback would see no frames; `native/window.cpp` installs one in all three headless
paths (frame-skip, input replay, plain) and in the window.

## 4. The `.gt4scene` format

Little endian. Header: magic `GT4S`, version, target (0 = v2.00), reserved. Then frame blocks, each prefixed with its own
byte length so a reader can skip one it does not understand. A frame holds: index, guest VBlank, the camera record,
texture records (40 bytes each, deduplicated by guest address), material records (80 bytes each), the draw records and one
packet block with every item's VIF bytes. The draw record holds the `Cmd` header, up to 256 items (guest address, QWC,
`event`, resolved record indices, packet offset/length), the sparse PGL spans, `vf24..vf31`, and the matrix packet read
back after the call. `native/coregs3/coregs3_scene.hpp` is the authority; `coregs3_fixture.cpp` pins the round trip.

Captures are derived from the user's own disc and stay under `build/evidence/` (ignored). Nothing is committed.

## 5. What the first captures show

Scene A: `licenca-b1` (v2.00, the plan's P1-A). Scene B: `night-run.sh` (P1-B, GT Mode B-Spec, six cars).

| Measurement | Scene A | Scene B |
|---|---|---|
| shape calls per frame | ~220 (course and scenery) | ~250 |
| draws inside the K5 bracket | **0** during the timed run | **116** |
| textures / materials per bracket frame | – | 169 / 39 |
| packet bytes per bracket frame | – | ~182 KB |

**Scene A has no car in the main view.** The reference frame at VBlank 2060 is a bumper camera: the road, the HUD and the
back-mirror strip, no car body. `render_cars` is called (the bracket runs) and returns without a single `pgluCallShape`
call. The car only appears at the result screen (VBlank ~3000), which is a different pass. So P1-A is a valid **identity**
scene (hooks do nothing) but not a **car** scene. Scene B is the car scene, as the plan's P1-B expected.

Channel layout of a car shape (`night-run`, VBlank 7398, draw 0, 3 items): per item one `V3-32` single vector at TOPS qword
`0xC0` (auxiliary), then `V3-16` positions at TOPS `0x00`, `V4-8` at TOPS `0x80`, and `V1-8` at TOPS `0x40`
(**C** from the capture; the last channel is all zeros in every observed car frame, so it is not a strip table).
The course shapes add `V2-16`/`V2-32` UVs at TOPS `0x40` and use absolute `0xC0`-range channels as well.

The matrix: the eight qwords at the PGL output cursor, read back after the call, are exactly
`tag, rows 0-2 × value, vf27, m2[0..3]` (**C**, the tag is `0x10000008`/`0x6C08C0C1`). Rows 0-2 are scaled by the shape's
`value` (≈ 1/4096 per car) and row 3 (`vf27`) is **not** scaled: in the observed car frames it holds a world position
(~`18.6, 86.1, 138.4`), not a projection row. The `+0xFA0` block is not a projection matrix in these frames either (it
holds screen-centre-like 2D state), so its role stays **U**. The VU1 vertex formula (which register is the projection, and
the exact clip mapping) is therefore still open: plan step 1d's tap is the instrument that will settle it.

The positions themselves are right: a point-cloud render of the captured car geometry (offline, no guest involvement)
shows the car silhouette. Triangle topology (strip vs list, and the strip table's location) is **not** solved: both
linear readings produce wrong surfaces, so the offline milestone picture is a point cloud, labelled as such. The offline
tool keeps every mode behind a flag so the next round can compare.

## 6. Gates run in this round

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| G-LOGIC on P1-A (`licenca-b1`, 3,511 VBlanks, 1,576 racing) | race clock, per-VBlank digest and the 64 KiB state dump identical in ref, `off` and `shadow` |
| G-OFF / G-SHADOW frame identity | **not an oracle at 1x**: the reference build differs from itself in frame 3275 (same box). Must run at 3x. |
| CTest `build/t090-v200-coregs3` | 319 tests, 100% passed, 1 skipped (PCSX2-dump test) |
| Python `tests/python` | 809 tests, OK, 57 skipped |
| G-ROBUST (capture) | 0 read failures, 0 orphan pass ends, 0 capacity refusals on the observed frames |
| G-TAP, G-IMAGE, G-PERF | not run yet (the tap and the live seam do not exist) |
